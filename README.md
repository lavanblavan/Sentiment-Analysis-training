# Sentiment Analysis Training

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on training a **Sentiment Analysis Model** to classify text as **positive, negative, or neutral** using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on labeled datasets and evaluated for accuracy and performance.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and text normalization.
- **Feature Engineering**: TF-IDF, word embeddings, and BERT representations.
- **Model Training**: Various classifiers including Naïve Bayes, SVM, LSTMs, and Transformer-based models.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, Precision, and Recall.
- **Deployment Ready**: Can be integrated into applications via API.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: NLTK, SpaCy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, Docker (for deployment)



## 📈 Training Process
1. **Load and Clean Data** 📊
2. **Feature Extraction** 🔍
3. **Train Machine Learning / Deep Learning Model** 🤖
4. **Evaluate Performance** 📉
5. **Save and Deploy Model** 🚀

## 📊 Results & Evaluation
